Please also supply your answer to the following questions:
1. What is the complexity of your algorithm (in big O notation)?
2. How would you improve your algorithm?
3. How would your adapt your algorithm to three dimensions? How would that affect
   the complexity?
   
Responses:

1. unknown
2. create a strategy to group pairs with proxyity indice (x + y diff) compared to a pair
3. 
- we have for now a 100x100 = so 10000 possibles positions.
- if we create a cube (100x100x100) there is 1000000 possibilities of position. so if we add
z indice on Position and Grid, the issue will be the charge due to the search of position for a
  vessel on the grid.

Have a good code reading :)

you can try make core.tests
